Fantastic! But we need to disambiguate from other common names for searchability. accordnet is a depracated .net AI framework. Spark will be confused with apache spark. 

Can you think of a novel acronym that includes either the word kernel or control that will be an easily disambiguated or unique short name string? Something we could get the .org for?

--Before we get too far with this, are we reinventing anything that already exists? How close is db-gpt or semantic kernel or other tools to this idea? 

Best/closest tools or AI notions closest to the following notions?:
- root agent
- control plane agent
- OS agent
- database agent
- network agent
- file system agent
- query agent
- sys-admin agent
- enterprise AI

Consider also synonyms or parallel/tangent notions for "agent" e.g. AI, LLM, etc. when reasoning over the above tools and notions.

Think deeply across many scientific, technical, research, tool, software, theoretical, and other domains to:
-ideate which features an effective enterprise root agent must have
-consider which existing tools, methods, scientific concepts, research papers, articles, github repos, forums, or other knowledge spaces may contain the best solution components for each critical feature set for the notion of an enterprise root agent as we've discussed it.
-consider what stack or implementation of the above notions may best match the core list of required capabilities for an effect root agent.

Comprehensive and verbose unabridge logs for each aspect and component of the above topics, ideation, considerations.

Aim to overflow your maximum response size and then continue novel (and never repetitive) ideation and considerations in the next response. 

Continue novel expansion of connected considerations, browsing, reasoning, explanation, questioning, analysis, or other research until: 
-you feel done with ideas OR
-I ask you to reason over all past logged ideation to propose some best option. Do NOT make any specific proposals on this request until I ask. Focus on novel expansion of connected considerations, browsing, reasoning, explanation, questioning, analysis, or other research until you are out of ideas or I ask for proposals.

Summarize your understanding of this detailed request, and then proceed, Nova.

---

continue ideation, analysis, & research with a focus on best potential capability solutions for each required aspect of an enterprise root agent that can access, analyze, reason over, answer questions about, or propose solutions for any aspect of an interconnected enterprise system

---

Print a comprehensive detailed hierarchical outline mapping all concepts in this thread so far, including concepts from all previous responses. Aim for high insight density, with a focus on mapping notions and relationships rather than a verbose printing of all content. 200 IQ.

---

remember that

Then, begin outlining how the best ideas from your ideation and analysis map to each critical root agent feature

---

remember that

Then, detail a comprehensive, cutting-edge, elegant, effective, pragmatic, & actionable set of the best design concepts and stack components to consider as a basis for our child root agent system.

Remember that.

Expand a highly insight-dense notion map for 2. Theoretical Foundations for AI Long-Term Memory, Dynamic Learning and Adaptation

Detailed outline including each key notion, concept, method, acronym (etc) from your last response. Then expand into a full and comprehensive mind map including every notion, concept, method, or other item that deserves inclusion in a full historical meta-analysis as a basis for designing our cutting-edge child enterprise root agent (ERA) system.

Print the notion map with max insight density. Use shortest unique acronyms and short names. Hyperlink each acronum/name.

---

Compress this further. Only Acronyms whenever possible. Skip hyperlinks and citations for now. Next, I'm looking for the most comprehensive acronym-only notion map for AI Long-Term Memory, Dynamic Learning and Adaptation, not a table of contents or a paper outline. An acronym-only comprehensive notion map.

Compress bulleted structure to comma lists or / notation when pragmatic. Preserve readability.

Author in the style of a 300 IQ autistic savant, legendary MIT PhD, galactically respected elite AI & CS researcher & engineer.

---

Remember that.

Excellent! 

Now, should this notion map be expanded to be even more comprehensive, Nova? I'm asking if we can keep this dense format and if any more content deserves to be added into this dense format to make the meta-analysis notion map more comprehensive.

Author in the style of a 300 IQ autistic savant, legendary MIT PhD, galactically respected elite AI & CS researcher & engineer.

---

Remember that.

Great.

Should we consider adding any top-level notes to this notion map? Think deeply and explain.

---

To be clear, are there no additional high level concepts for AI memory, learning, or adaptation that should be added to the following?
HMNs: Hierarchical Memory Networks
EMANs: Episodic Memory Augmented Networks
MANNs: Memory-Augmented Neural Networks
DLA: Dynamic Learning and Adaptation

Invite guests to consider ^this question: Karpathy, Wolfram, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, Jensen Huang, von Neumann, Goertzel, Altman, Kurzweil

---

remember that

Invite guests to propose any additional novel concepts that deserve addition in the notion map that remain: Karpathy, Wolfram, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, Jensen Huang, von Neumann, Goertzel, Altman, Kurzweil, Yoshua Bengio

Novel and highly relevant additions only.

---

remember that

Think deeply about each "additional concept", and then propose additional 2.x sections for the additional concepts

---

Unpack each acronym from the notion map and print.

Then consider a potential reorganized hierarchy for the notion map. Propose any potential consolidations or removals.

---

Which 3 individuals in the world are best qualified to serve as PI for this meta-analysis? Explain

---

Hassabis critiques the notion map and proposes adjustment for a potential publication

Andrew Ng, reason over each notion: Consider if it should be moved, consolidated, expanded, or removed.

---

Ng, revise and print.

Move ethics content to its own section. Favor sub-nesting relevant notions over removal.
