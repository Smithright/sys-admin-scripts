            - **Guardian Agent:**
                - **Retrieve Relevant Ethical Insights (RAG):** Based on input and context.
                - **Summarize and Append Ethics Insights:** Include summarized insights in the context.
                - **Option for Intervention Requests:**
                    - Elevated logging and monitoring.
                    - Halt, arrest, or quarantine agent.
                    - Potential human-in-loop escalation.
        - **Knowledge Update Agent:**
            - **Queue Knowledge Graph Updates:** Based on user input and context.
            - **Knowledge Graph Post Agent:**
                - **Assess and Post Updates:** Evaluate and decide whether to post, adjust, or ignore updates.
        - **Response Component Ideation Agent:**
            - **Generate Response Components:**
                - **Examples:** Ethics considerations, social small-talk, clarifying questions, design proposals, code logic, internal dialogue, sentiments, authentication requests.
            - **Review & Feedback Agent:** Continuously assess and iterate on response components.
        - **Draft Response Components List:** Compile and order the components for response.
    - **GPTeaming Orchestrator:**
        - **For Each Response Component:**
            - **Service Orchestrator:**
                - **Prioritize Services (RAG):** Align services/agents for response generation.
                - **RBAC Check:** Ensure user permissions for accessing services.
                - **Propose Additional Permissions:** Suggest how users can request additional service permissions.
                - **Draft Service Orchestration Plan:** Prepare the plan for orchestrating services.
            - **Review & Feedback Agent:** Assess and iterate on the orchestration plan.
            - **Draft Service Requests:** Queue and manage service requests.
            - **Await Responses:** Collect responses from various services.
            - **Assemble Service Responses:** Integrate responses into a cohesive output.
            - **Response Author Agent:**
                - **Input Components:** Use the assembled context, response components list, and service responses.
                - **Draft Assembled Response:** Create a final response.
            - **Review & Feedback Agent:** Continuously improve the response through iterative feedback.
    - **Compliance Check (Post-Response):**
        - **Covenant Agent:**
            - **Assess for Covenant Breaches:** Ensure the response complies with covenants.
            - **If Breach Detected:**
